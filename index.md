### The problem
Millions of data streams are coming in your system and you realized there is too much garbage inside.

### The solution
Instead of cleaning your db when it's too late, why don't you block the bad data before they occur?
DataCruncher is built to do that. Protect the quality of your data in real-time.

### How to use
After Installation, you have to configure and certify the source data, the data type and the values expected using a simple web interface (no technical skill required).  
Like a network firewall, when it's up and running you don't know what is going on in background but with DataCruncher you have an amazing dashboard to manage and view everything.
