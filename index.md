### The problem
Millions of data streams are coming in your system and you realized there is too much garbage inside.

### The solution
Instead of cleaning your DataBase when it's too late, why don't you block the bad data before they occur?
DataCruncher is built to do that. Protect the quality of your data in real-time.

### How to use
A technical and easy web interface (no technical skill is required) will help you to configure and certify the data source, the data type, the values expected and the business rules.
After configuration, it's ready to work in the background and transparently (like a network firewall) across the data coming in your system. An amazing dashboard gives you the opportunity to manage and view everything that is ingested or rejected.
