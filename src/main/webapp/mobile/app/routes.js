Sample usage: * * Connects http://myapp.com/#home to the index controller's overview action: * map.connect("home", {controller: 'index', action: 'overview'}); * * Connects urls like "images/myImage.jpg" to the images controller's show action, passing * "myImage.jpg" as the "url" property of the options object each controller action receives: * map.connect("images/:url", {controller: 'images', action: 'show'}); * * Your app.js file can specify a defaultUrl config property, which will be dispatched to if there is * no specified url when the application first loads. */Ext.Router.draw(function(map) {    //These are default fallback routes and can be removed if not needed    map.connect(':controller/:action');    map.connect(':controller/:action/:id');});
