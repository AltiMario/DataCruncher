Protect the quality of your data in real-time.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nAfter Installation, you have to configure and certify the source data, the data type and the values expected using a simple web interface (no technical skill required).  \r\nLike a network firewall, when it's up and running you don't know what is going on in background but with SeerDataCruncher you have an amazing dashboard to manage and view everything.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nIn 2014, [Alfredo Gemma](https://it.linkedin.com/in/alfredo-gemma-7273828/it) and [Mario Altimari](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/altimario) founded foreSEE-Revolution, the parent-company of [see-r.com](http://www.see-r.com), where SeerDataCruncher is applied within our Enterprise edition of SEE-R.  \r\nWe decided to offer the community this technology, hoping it will prove useful in the fight against data-corruption.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nCheck out our [documentation](https://github.com/see-r/SeerDataCruncher) or [contact support](http://see-r.com/about/contacts/) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-49109406-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
